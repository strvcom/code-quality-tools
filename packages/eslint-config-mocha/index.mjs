    // Set Maximum Depth of Nested Callbacks
    // This rule is aimed at increasing code clarity by discouraging deeply nesting callbacks.
    // Allow some extra nesting for Mocha tests, due to Mocha's test coding patterns encouraging
    // some extra callback nesting.
    'max-nested-callbacks': ['warn', 6],

    // Enforces handling of callbacks for async tests
    // Mocha allows you to write asynchronous tests by adding a done callback to the parameters of
    // your test function. It is easy to forget calling this callback after the asynchronous
    // operation is done.

    // Disallow async functions passed to describe
    // This rule disallows the use of an async function with describe. It usually indicates a
    // copy/paste error or that you're trying to use describe for setup code, which should happen
    // in before or beforeEach.

    // This rule reminds you to remove .only from your tests by raising a warning whenever you are
    // using the exclusivity feature.

    // This rule checks each mocha test function to not be located directly in the global scope.
    'mocha/no-global-tests': 'warn',

    // Disallow identical titles
    // This rule looks at the title of every test and test suites. It will report when two test
    // suites or two test cases at the same level of a test suite have the same title.

    // Disallow returning in a test or hook function that uses a callback
    // Mocha's tests or hooks (like before) may be asynchronous by either returning a Promise or
    // specifying a callback parameter for the function. It can be confusing to have both methods
    // used in a test or hook, and from Mocha v3 on, causes the test to fail in order to force
    // developers to remove this source of confusion.
    'mocha/no-return-and-callback': 'error',

    // Disallow returning from an async test or hook
    // Mocha's tests or hooks (like before) may be asynchronous by returning a Promise. When such

    // when combined with an explicit return of a Promise, as it's mixing the two styles.

    // function calls and use of the dot operator (due to getters and setters) directly in
    // describe blocks.
