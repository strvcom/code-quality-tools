    // problems when used in other locations.

    // In Node.js, the behavior of the Buffer constructor is different depending on the type of its

    // lead to security vulnerabilities such as remote memory disclosure and denial of service.

    // process.env outside of preparing configuration data should be discouraged.

    // errors always exit the process, but contrary to `process.exit()` they also print a stack
    // trace.
    'no-process-exit': 'error',
