    // lead to security vulnerabilities such as remote memory disclosure and denial of service.
    'no-buffer-constructor': 'error',

    // This rule is aimed at ensuring that callbacks used outside of the main function block are
    // always part of or immediately preceding a return statement.

      // The following variables will be considered callbacks. More can be added as necessary.

    // Enforce `require()` on the top-level module scope
    // It's arguably harder to identify dependencies when they are deeply nested inside of functions
    // and other statements. Since require() does a synchronous load, it can cause performance
    // problems when used in other locations.
    'node/global-require': 'warn',

    // Enforce Callback Error Handling
    // This rule expects that when you're using the callback pattern in node you'll handle the
    // error. Matches: err, Err, error, someErr, someError, any_error, ...
    'node/handle-callback-err': ['error', '^.*(e|E)rr(or)?'],

    // Ensure the Node.js error-first callback pattern is followed
    // When invoking a callback function which uses the Node.js error-first callback pattern, all of
    // your errors should either use the Error class or a subclass of it. It is also acceptable to
    // use undefined or null if there is no error.
    'node/no-callback-literal': ['warn'],

    // This rule is aimed at disallowing `exports = {}`.

    // developers use a platform-independent way of creating paths (we feel you, Windows).
    'node/no-path-concat': 'error',

    // Disallow process.env
    // This rule is aimed at discouraging use of process.env to avoid global dependencies throughout
    // the project's codebase.

    // Note: Env vars are a great way of managing configuration options. This rule can be safely
    // turned off for a particular file/folder where project configuration is gathered and stored in

    // process.env outside of preparing configuration data should be discouraged.

    // trace.
    'node/no-process-exit': 'error',

    // Disallow Synchronous Methods

    // specifically for the method suffix "Sync" (as is the convention with Node.js operations).

    // versions your module is supporting.

    // your module is supporting.

    // analysis.

    // Suggest correct usage of shebang

    // is not a shebang.
